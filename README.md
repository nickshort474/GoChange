<h2>Start</h2>
Users may click start from the home screen and be provided with a number of text 
entry boxes allowing them to name and give details of the problem they are looking 
to solve. The user also has the option of adding any existing, known solutions to 
the problem if they wish.

<h2>Search</h2>
The second option on the home screen is search, here the user is presented with a search box 
which will search the GoChange database for problems related to the search term. The user is
also presented with a shiort list of recently added problems for them to look into.
Once a problem is selected it can be followed so the user can track the problem and any solutions
added provided.

<h2>Follow</h2>
The third option on the home screen is follow. This lists all the problems created by the user and
any problems followed after a search or from the recently added list. When any of these problems 
are selected the most up to date set of solutions are downloaded to the app and displayed.

<h2> Additional features</h2>
Each solution posted also comes with the option of linking a change.org petition to the solution.
A user can click the change.org link and the app will open an instance of safari, navigate to the 
change.org site and allow the user to navigate to an appropriate petition page. Instructions are 
provided to show the user how to copy the pages URL so that when they return to GoChange the URL 
can be used to create a link to that petition.
